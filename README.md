# Amsterdam Eats

Web app that shows popular restaurants within the Amsterdam city center! The app has the following features:

1. Full-fledged interactive map using the Google Maps API;
2. Nearby search data for restaurant names and addresses;
3. Number of Foursquare check-ins plus links to each restaurant's website;
4. Ability to filter results by name; and
5. A fully responsive (and fun!) user interface.

This project is done under the [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).
